To achieve this, Slayer provides base classes for writing small, composable services, which should behave as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).\r\n\r\nSlayer Services should implement `call`, which will `pass` or `fail` the service based on input. Services return a `Slayer::Result` which has a predictable interface for determining `success?` or `failure?`, a `message`, and a `result`.\r\n\r\nServices are composed by Composers, which describe the order and arguments for running a number of Services in sequence. If any of these Services fail, those run before it are rolled back by calling `rollback` on the service, passing the service its `result` object, and the original parameters.\r\n\r\nComposers also return a `Slayer::Result` object, which has as its `result` parameter a hash of the result objects from its composed services.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'slayer'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install slayer\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# A service that passes when given the string \"foo\"\r\n# and fails if given anything else.\r\nclass FooService < Slayer::Service\r\n    def call(foo:)\r\n      if foo == \"foo\"\r\n        pass! result: foo, message: \"Passing FooService\"\r\n      else\r\n        fail! result: foo, message: \"Failing FooService\"\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# A placeholder service that always passes with returned result\r\n# as the argument passed into it.\r\nclass BarService < Slayer::Service\r\n    def call(bar:)\r\n        pass! result: bar, message: \"Passing BarService\"\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# A simple composer which composes the FooService and BarService\r\nclass FooBarComposer < Slayer::Composer\r\n    compose FooService, BarService\r\n\r\n    def call\r\n        pass! result: @results,  message: \"Yay!\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def foo_service_args\r\n        return { foo: @composer_params[:foo] }\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def bar_service_args\r\n        return { bar: foo_service_results.message }\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\nresult = FooBarComposer.call(foo: \"Jim\", bar: \"Joe\")\r\nresult.success? # => true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/apsislabs/slayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n",
